            A doll is a <br> model typically <br>of a human <br>
            humanoid character,<br> often used as a <br>toy for children. <br>
            Traditional dolls<br> made of materials <br>such as clay <br>and wood are found in the Americas, Asia,
            Africa and Europe. <br>
            The earliest documented dolls go back to the
            ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome.<br>
            They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art. <br>
            Modern doll manufacturing has its
            roots in Germany, from the 15th century.<br>
            With industrialization and new
            materials such as porcelain and plastic, <br>
            dolls were increasingly mass-produced.
            During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles.
