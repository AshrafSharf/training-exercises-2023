        <h1>Doll Model</h1>
        <p class="doll-content"> 
            A doll is a <br> model typically <br>of a human <br>
             humanoid character,<br> often used as a <br>toy for children. <br>
            Traditional dolls<br> made of materials <br>such as clay <br>and wood are found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe. <br>
            The earliest documented dolls go back to the 
            ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome.<br>
             They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art. <br>
             Modern doll manufacturing has its 
             roots in Germany, from the 15th century.<br>
              With industrialization and new 
              materials such as porcelain and plastic, <br>
              dolls were increasingly mass-produced.
               During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles.
