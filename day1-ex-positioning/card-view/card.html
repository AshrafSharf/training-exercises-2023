    <p>Clarityâ€™s designs stem from continuous exploration and research.
      These designs are built into our HTML/CSS components,
      which can be used with any web UI, regardless of the underlying JavaScript framework.
      Clarity also offers a set of well-designed and implemented data-bound components built on top of Angular,
      one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks in the industry.</p>
    <p>We offer three approaches for utilizing Clarity: just the UX guidelines, UX guidelines and our HTML/CSS framework, or put everything together with our Angular implementation.</p>
    <p>Jumpstart your project with one of our Sketch or Figma-based design resources. Start by downloading the Metropolis fonts. Then download your resources of choice. We recommend that with your UI Library selection, that you also select the matching Icon Library as the two work together.</p>
